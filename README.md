# CLONIFY --- By Romain DUPONT

Personal project, which is a barebone clone of Spotify. As of now it only takes a downloaded MP3 file and read it. 

I made it so that it works on my personal machine which runs Debian 12, so it might not be able to run on other Linux systems, and will definitely not run on Windows and Mac machine.
